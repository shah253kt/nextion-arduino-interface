# Nextion Interface
[Nextion](https://nextion.tech/) is an inexpensive Human Machine Interaction (HMI) solution that is easy to configure. This library allows us to communicate with the display device.

The main purpose of this library is to reduce the size and simplify the library. This resulting in shifting some of the complexity onto the user themselves. Not all instruction sets are implemented. Check out the examples to help you get started.
